# hello-world
My first repository to get used to the GitHub platform and its functions.

Hello everyone! 

This is simply my first message on GitHub that I'm practicing to familiarize myself with this neat tool. I'm in my mid-twenties working as an RF Engineer and I'm seeking to expand my skill set by dipping my hands into the software world of coding and programming. It's my hope to ultimately combine both the hardware and software experiences I've had to turn them into a powerful hybrid that'll benefit my career in a highly competetive day in age we live in now. Here's to hoping GitHub will take me there!
